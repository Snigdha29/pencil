Queries/Plans -
I think the current footer looks classy. So I will only make changes that you specify because I'm not sure what changes to add there. I think we can add spaces between the main content and next/previous article, and between next/previous article and comments section. And add some different style for visited and unvisited posts, and make the links for posts more prominent.
